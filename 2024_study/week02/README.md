## 2. Text-Based Maze Game

- **Features:**
  - A game where a 2D array represents a maze.
  - Players navigate the maze to find the exit.
  - Provides feedback such as "wall" or "path" based on moves.

- **Concepts Used:**
  - Arrays: To represent the maze layout.
  - Pointers: For efficient navigation and game logic.
  - User Input Handling: To process player moves and actions.

- **Learning Objectives:**
  - Learn how to use 2D arrays to model complex structures.
  - Practice working with pointers for efficient manipulation of data.
  - Develop user interaction skills by handling real-time input and feedback.

- **Expansion Possibilities:**
  - Add multiple difficulty levels with larger and more complex mazes.
  - Introduce a timer to increase the challenge.
  - Implement dynamic maze generation for replayability.

## 3. Library Management System

- **Features:**
  - Manages book details, including title, author, and borrowing status.
  - Allows users to borrow and return books.
  - Tracks book availability and displays borrowing history.

- **Concepts Used:**
  - Structures: To store and manage book details.
  - File Input/Output: To save and load book data for persistence.
  - Menu Interface: For user-friendly navigation of options.

- **Learning Objectives:**
  - Understand how to design systems that involve multiple data attributes.
  - Practice implementing file operations for data storage and retrieval.
  - Learn to build a simple menu-driven interface for user interaction.

- **Expansion Possibilities:**
  - Add a search function to find books by title or author.
  - Track overdue books and implement a fine system.
  - Create a graphical interface or a mobile app version of the system.
